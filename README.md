# Cafe Digital System


## Overview

This project is a **Cafe Digital System** designed as part of my first semester-end project. It serves as a simple digital interface for managing cafe operations, allowing users to view the menu, place orders, and calculate bills. The system is implemented using fundamental programming concepts such as basic functions, loops, switches, and file handling.

## Features
- Display cafe menu with prices
- Take customer orders and calculate total cost
- Handle multiple orders in a single session
- Apply discounts and special offers (if any)
- Save and retrieve order history using file handling
- Basic user interaction with input validation



## Programming Concepts Used
- **Basic Functions**: Modular design with separate functions for each task (e.g., displaying menu, taking orders, calculating total).
- **Loops**: For iterating over the menu and customer orders, allowing continuous interaction with the system.
- **Switch-Case Statements**: Used for selecting menu options and handling customer choices efficiently.
- **Conditionals**: To handle input validation and apply logic like discounts and offers.
- **Arrays**: For storing menu items and calculating totals.
- **File Handling**: Orders and menu data are stored in and retrieved from files to simulate data persistence.
- **Input and Output**: Taking user input for orders and displaying results using `cin` and `cout`.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error checks for invalid inputs or selections.

## Technologies Used
- **C++**: Core programming language used for the project.
